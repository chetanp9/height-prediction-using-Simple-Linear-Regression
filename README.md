# Height Prediction Using Linear Regression

This project demonstrates how to predict a person's height based on their weight using a simple linear regression model. The notebook includes steps for data preprocessing, model training, evaluation, and prediction.

## Contents

- `height prediction using linear regression.ipynb`: The main Jupyter Notebook that contains the code and analysis.
- `weight-height.xlsx`: The dataset used for training the model

## Overview

This project involves the following steps:

1. **Data Import and Preprocessing**:
   - Load the dataset.
   - Standardize the features using `StandardScaler`.

2. **Model Training**:
   - Train a linear regression model to predict height based on weight.
   - Evaluate the model's performance and coefficients using statistical methods.

3. **Prediction**:
   - Use the trained model to predict the height for new data, e.g., a person weighing 102 kg.
